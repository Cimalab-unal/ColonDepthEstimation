This code provides the resulting model from implementation of the work "SfSNet - Leveraging a realistic synthetic database to learn shape-from-Shading for estimating the colon depth in colonoscopy images".

Follow these instructions to run the tests and reproduce the reported results. The full code will be released after publication. 

These scripts are designed to be easily run in a free Google Colab environment. The file also contains the test collections, the synthetic and the real.

	1-  Option 1: Download this repository and upload the complete repository in your Google Drive account.

        Option 2: Fork this repository and open the notebooks in Google colab by accessing in "https://colab.research.google.com/" and selecting the repository and notebook using the tool 'GitHub'.


	2- Open and execute the notebooks "testing_synthetic_database.ipynb" or "testing_real_database.ipynb" in Google Colab.


Notes:
	- If you want to save estimated depth maps, set the variable "params['imgSave']=True", and they will be saved in the folder named "results".
